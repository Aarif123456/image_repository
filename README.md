## Technology stack :gear:

* **React**: [React](https://reactjs.org/) is declarative, component-based language that makes it easier to quickly single-page applications.
* **Typescript**: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a JavaScript extension, which is used to encourage developers to write more maintainable code. It compiles to JavaScript so it can be run on any modern browser.
* **ESLint**: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a static analyzer for JavaScript. In our code we also use it to ensure our translation json files are also in the correct format.
* **Jest**: [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) is a simple, yet comprehensive testing framework which works well with React. 
* **React-Intl**: [React-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/) is a JavaScript library that makes simplifies the process of internalization for web-applications.
* **Formik**: [Formik](https://formik.org/docs/overview) is a light weight library that handles form creation and management in React.
* **Axios**: [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) is a promise based HTTP client which simplifies the connecting to the API for this website. 
* **Dropzone**: [Dropzone](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) is HTML5-compliant and drag and drop component for file uploading. It allows us to select multiple files at once and handles basic file validation.
* **Material-UI**: [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) is a React library that implements [Google's Material Design](https://material.io/design). It lets quickly create beautiful components so we can focus more on the functionality.
